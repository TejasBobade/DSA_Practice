//  Time complexity
/*
- If the operation are constant then complexity will be => O(1)
- Dones't matter number of constant operation ex. 3, 4, 10, ... the complexity will be O(1) always

- If the operation is changing if perspective of n then the complexity is => O(n)
- ex. 2n It will increase as n is increasing and it is increasing in constant way

- If operation changing in exponational minor then complexity is => O(n^2)
ex. n^2 or n * n in this case the change is not constant it's a bad complexity
*/


// Space Complexity
/*
- ammount of memory an algorithm needs to run 

// primitive Types ->
// Boolean, num, undefined, null; => Constant
// String, Array, Objects => Dynamic
